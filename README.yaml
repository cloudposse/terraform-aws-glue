  The following Glue resources are supported:
  
    - Catalog database
    - Catalog table
    - Connection
    - Crawler
    - Job
    - Registry
    - Schema
    - Trigger

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For an example on how to provision source and destination S3 buckets, Glue Catalog Database and Table, and a Glue Crawler that processes 
  data in the source S3 bucket and writes the result into the destination S3 bucket, 
  see [examples/crawler](examples/crawler).

  For an example on how to provision a Glue Workflow with Glue Jobs and Glue Triggers, 
  see [examples/workflow](examples/workflow).

  For automated tests of the examples using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the examples on AWS), see [test](test).
